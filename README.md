# What is this?
A Unity project configured for VR in which you can climb up rocks that appear above you along a wall.
The rocks act as climb handles and appear based on spawn zones.
It's fun to do for a while and it was fun to develop but I quickly realized that constantly looking up put quite a lot of strain on my neck, which is not fun at all.

# Features
## Spawn Zone Feature
Spawn zones for the rock climb handles can dynamically be created in the editor using a spawn zone feature.
You can configure the amount, horizontal and vertical placement deviation and other things.
## Sounds
There are sounds for the rocks appearing and also some abience + a self-composed music theme is incorporated.

# Prerequisites
## Unity version
This project uses Unity 2022.3.5f1
## VR Headset
This is a VR project so a HMD is required. I have tested this project with the Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3

# Limitations
## Build
I cannot guarantee a working build as this was never tested, it should work within the editor though.
## URP
This  project uses the Universal Render Pipeline so keep this in mind when you want to fork and extend this project.
